## Act II: Reversing the Supply Chain

### Location: GrinchTech Logistics Hub A (Formerly Hamburg Port Authority)

You arrive at Warehouse A. It’s not a distribution center—it’s a **black hole**.

Trucks arrive full of Christmas parcels, but they leave empty. Inside, you see the horror: Giant robotic claws are grabbing beautifully wrapped gifts, scanning them, and dropping them onto a conveyor belt labeled **"RECYCLING & INCINERATION."**

You scan your badge. The Grinch pops up on the monitor, looking smugly at a spreadsheet.

> **System Message from CEO**
>
> "Welcome to the 'GrinchTech Reverse-Logistics Hub.'
>
> You see, I bought the shipping rights for the entire city. Why? To save you from yourselves. Do you have any idea how much carbon footprint this 'gift-giving' generates? It’s irresponsible.
>
> My algorithms are currently set to **Intercept and Liquidate**. We are processing 5,000 'units of joy' per hour and converting them into compressed cubes of recyclable cardboard. It’s elegant. It’s sustainable. It’s over.
>
> If you're here to try and switch the belts back to 'Delivery Mode,' don't bother. The math required to reverse the torque on these crushers is beyond you."

## The Challenge

::: {.scenario-block}

To save the presents, you must **reverse** the operational parameters of the machinery.

**Task a) The Crusher Belt**

The main conveyor belt is currently set to "Ramming Speed" ($s$) to smash packages into the incinerator. The equation governing the speed is:
$$3(s + 4) - 2s = 20$$

> **Grinch's Note:** "No pressure. Well, actually, lots of pressure."

**Objective:** The Grinch set this for maximum destruction. Solving this identifies the velocity. Once identified, the system will allow you to invert the motor polarity.

**Solve for s (Crusher Velocity):**

</div>

**Task b) The "Waste" Audit**

The Grinch has categorized all presents as "Trash." You need to hack the inventory log to recategorize them as "Assets" so the system won't burn them.

* **Total items intercepted:** 25
* **"Standard Junk" Value:** €3 | **"Premium Junk" Value:** €5
* **Total Liquidation Value:** €95

> **Grinch's Note:** "A classic two-equation, two-unknown problem. Total items. Total value. I learned this in fifth grade. I was bored then too, but at least I paid attention."

**Objective:** Identify how many Standard ($x$) and Premium ($y$) gifts are currently in the hopper so you can reroute them.

</div>

<div class="quiz-actions">

  <button class="quiz-submit" disabled>Recategorize as "Gifts"</button>
</div>

**Task c) The Claw Calibration**

The robotic claw is programmed to **crush** ($|2x - 7| = 3$). You need to solve this to find the grip boundaries.

> **Grinch's Note:** "The current setting applies 4,000 PSI of pressure. Enough to turn a Playstation into a frisbee. Don't touch it."

### Status Update

You hit Enter. The facility groans.

The conveyor belt screeches to a halt, then slowly reverses direction. The sign above the pit changes from **"INCINERATOR"** to **"OUTBOUND DELIVERY."**

The robotic claw stops crushing a Lego set and gently places it onto a delivery truck.

The Grinch appears on the screen, looking furious. He spills a drop of his kale smoothie.

> **System Message from CEO**
>
> "What did you do?!
>
> You reversed the flow? Do you know how much paperwork this creates? I had those crushing quotas approved by the board!
>
> You may have saved this batch of 'consumerist clutter,' but Warehouse B is where I keep the **difficult stuff*.
>
> Good job, hero."
> -- GR

**System Status:**

* **Incinerator:** OFFLINE
* **Delivery Mode:** ACTIVE
* **Presents Saved:** 2,500
