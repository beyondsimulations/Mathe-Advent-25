## Act III: Business Model Analysis

### Location: Hamburg Economic Forecast Center

The economic battle has moved to Hamburg's Forecast Center. Today's session focuses on how external factors—inflation, taxes, regulations—transform business models mathematically.

The Grinch has prepared a presentation titled: "Economic Scenarios: How External Factors Destroy Christmas Profitability." He appears on screen wearing what looks like a very expensive cardigan. Academic villain chic.

"Economic reality is transformation," he declares. "Your baseline models might show profit at the vertex—but add inflation, impose new taxes, introduce regulations, and suddenly Christmas is mathematically doomed."

> "You've proven you understand static functions. How quaint.
>
> But business isn't static. A 4% inflation shift. A regulatory compression. A market crash that reflects everything into negative territory. These are TRANSFORMATIONS. And they destroy your pretty profit parabolas.
>
> Let's see if you can even identify transformations, let alone defend against them.
>
> I'll use a simple base function: $f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3$
>
> Watch how easily I can transform profitability into catastrophe. Or don't watch. I'll do it anyway."

## The Challenge

::: {.scenario-block}

Analyze how external economic factors transform the base function $f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3$. The Grinch has named each scenario with his characteristic dramatic flair.

**Lock 1: "The Inflation Avalanche"**

A 4% inflation rate effectively shifts all costs upward by 4 units.

> **Grinch's Note:** "Vertical shifts. Add to the function. This is... genuinely the easiest transformation. If you miss this, I'm going to assume you're doing it on purpose to waste my time."

**If $f(x)$ shifts UP by 4 units, what is the constant term in $g(x)$?**

**Lock 2: "The Regulatory Shift"**

New EU regulations create administrative overhead, shifting all operations LEFT by 3 time units. The transformation rule is $g(x) = f(x + 3)$.

> **Grinch's Note:** "Horizontal shifts are where students fall apart. It's counterintuitive and beautiful. Like watching someone confidently walk into a glass door. This one brings me joy."

**After shifting $f(x)$ LEFT by 3 units, what is the coefficient of $x$ in the expanded form of $g(x)$?**

**Enter the coefficient of x:**

**Lock 3: "The Market Crash Mirror"**

An economic downturn reflects market conditions over the $x$-axis, inverting profits into losses.

> **Grinch's Note:** "Reflections. The mirror image of your hopes. The negative sign affects EVERYTHING, and yet somehow people still mess this up. I have a bet with my assistant. Don't prove her right."

**After reflection over the $x$-axis, what is the constant term in $g(x)$?**

**Lock 4: "The Growth Multiplier"**

A government stimulus package doubles all economic activity (vertical stretch by factor of 2).

> **Grinch's Note:** "Stretching. Like what your excuses do when you can't solve a problem. The government doubles everything—and I mean EVERYTHING. Process that."

**After vertical stretch by factor 2, what is the leading coefficient ($a$ in $ax^2$)?**

::: {.puzzle-box}
**Enter the coefficient:**

### Status Update

You present your transformation analysis:

- Inflation (up 4): $g(x) = x^2 - 2x + 7$ ✓
- Regulation (left 3): $g(x) = x^2 + 4x + 6$ ✓
- Market crash (reflect): $g(x) = -x^2 + 2x - 3$ ✓
- Growth (stretch 2): $g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 6$ ✓

But then you add: "However, the Grinch's analysis contains a critical flaw."

The room goes quiet.

"He only showed NEGATIVE transformations—inflation, crashes, costs. But transformations work both ways. Government support shifts functions UP. Efficiency improvements reflect profit-positive. Market growth stretches revenue."

You pull up your own analysis: "If we apply realistic positive transformations—EU Christmas market subsidies (shift up 10), local tourism growth (stretch 1.5), operational efficiencies (shift left 2 for earlier profitability)—the transformed function shows INCREASED profit, not decreased."

The Grinch's expression flickers. He wasn't expecting a counter-analysis.

> "Clever. You didn't just calculate transformations—you understood that transformations can be positive or negative depending on context.

> Fine. You understand function transformations. You can defend against my external shock scenarios.

> But here's the final business test: REVERSIBILITY. Can you undo my optimizations? Can you find inverse functions? Can you reverse-engineer my economic models to restore original Christmas operations?
>
> Tomorrow: Inverse functions and function composition. The mathematics of UNDOING what I've done.
>
> This is your last chance to prove Christmas is economically viable."

**Act III Progress:**

- ✓ Function fundamentals verified
- ✓ Linear business models validated
- ✓ Quadratic optimization mastered
- ✓ Function transformations mastered
- Inverse functions: Tomorrow (Final business challenge)

**Status:** Transformation defense successful; one more challenge remaining.

**Time Remaining:** 8 days until Christmas Eve
