## Act I: Infiltration

### Location: GrinchTech Backup Facility, Speicherstadt

You push through the heavy doors into the backup facility. It smells of ozone and... stale kale smoothies?

The room is a cavernous brick warehouse, but the center is dominated by **The Vault**. It’s an obnoxious cylinder of glass and chrome, glowing with a smug green light. Inside, you see the Holy Grail: *The Master Plan*. Physical files. Hard drives. A half-eaten sandwich labeled "Property of CEO."

You approach the terminal. It doesn't beep; it sighs. A holographic projection of the Grinch appears—not the scary version, but the annoyed, "this meeting could have been an email" version. He looks at you with deep exhaustion.

> **System Message from CEO**
>
> "Oh, for the love of... You're *still* here?
>
> I honestly thought the quadratic equations would bore you to death. Literally. I had the oxygen scrubbers set to 'Ennui.'
>
> Fine. You want into my private vault? You want to see how I plan to 'disrupt' your precious little holiday into a high-efficiency void of silence?
>
> Then prove you aren't just counting on your fingers. This is **Logarithmic Encryption**. It scales exponentially. Unlike your IQ, which seems to have plateaued somewhere around 'hamster.'
>
> Unlock these four tumblers. Or don't. I have a trapdoor scheduled to open in five minutes, and my crocodiles are hungry."

## The Challenge

::: {.scenario-block}

The keypad glares at you. The Grinch has renamed the security layers to mock you.

**Lock 1: "The Toddler Test"**

The system demands a basic evaluation to see if you're worth its CPU cycles.

$$\text{Evaluate: } \log_2(32)$$

> **Grinch's Note:** "If you need to count on your fingers for this, I'm activating the trapdoor early. The crocodiles haven't been fed for a while."

::: {.puzzle-box}
**Enter the value:**

<div class="quiz-actions">
  <p class="quiz-feedback"></p>
  <button class="quiz-submit" disabled data-answer="5">Prove Sentience</button>
</div>
:::

**Lock 2: "Redundancy for Idiots"**

The Grinch assumes you'll mess up the addition rule.

$$\log_3(9) + \log_3(27)$$

> **Grinch's Note:** "If you try to use a calculator for this, a small electric shock will be administered to your keyboard. I'm watching."

**Lock 3: "The Panic Inducer"**

A red countdown timer appears. It's moving uncomfortably fast.

$$\text{Solve for } x \text{ before the crocodiles are released: } \quad 5^x = 125$$

> **Grinch's Note:** "The clock is real. The crocodiles are real. Tick tock. They can hear your heartbeat through the floor sensors."

  <button class="quiz-submit" disabled data-answer="3">Stop the Timer</button>
</div>
:::

**Lock 4: "The Ego check"**

The final lock uses Base-4, just because the Grinch prefers it.

$$\text{Compute: } \log_4(64)$$

> **System Note:** "Most people fail here. Try not to be most people."

### Status Update

You punch in the final code. The vault lets out a disappointed groan, as if it can't believe you actually got it right. The glass slides open.

You grab the **Master Plan**. It's worse than you thought.
* **Protocol "Silent Night":** Using drones to absorb sound waves from carolers.
* **Project "Coal":** Converting all chocolate Santas into 99% dark cacao (the bitter kind).
* **The Algorithm:** A code designed to auto-cancel holiday flight reservations randomly.

Suddenly, the giant screen flickers. The Grinch appears again. He's holding a green juice and looking at his watch.

> "Ugh. The alarm. It's so loud. Can you hear that? I composed it myself. It's called 'The Sound of Your Futility.'
>
> So, you have my files. Bravo. You figured out logarithms. Would you like a participation trophy? I 3D-printed some, but I threw them in the Elbe.
>
> Look, you have the data, but you don't have the *keys*. My supply chain is encrypted with math so annoying, so tedious, that you'll wish you were back in algebra class.
>
> Go ahead. Try to fix Christmas. I'll be here, shorting the stock market on tinsel companies.
>
> Toodles."

> -- GR

The screen cuts to black. You have the files. You have a headache. And you have a very angry Grinch to stop.

**Critical Intel Acquired:**

- ✓ The Grinch's Ego (It's massive)
- ✓ Master Plan Files
- ✓ Knowledge that he drinks Kale Smoothies
