## Act II: Reversing the Supply Chain

### Location: Warehouse B, Speicherstadt

Warehouse B is huge. It houses Hamburg's presents across multiple climate-controlled storage rooms, each optimized for different types of gifts: electronics, textiles, and perishable goods.

You enter through a security checkpoint. Inside, the scale is overwhelming: a three-story atrium filled with automated storage racks extending in every direction.

The Grinch appears on the monitor, looking like he's in the middle of a spa day. He has cucumber slices on his eyes.

> **System Message from CEO**
>
> "Ugh. You again?
>
> Welcome to Warehouse B. This is where I store the *really* tricky stuff.
>
> Warehouse A was simple algebra. Warehouse B is a **Multi-Variable Nightmare**. I've hidden presents in Room X, Room Y, and Room Z, and I've linked their door codes together. You can't open one without balancing the others.
>
> It's called 'Systems of Equations,' and honestly, it's too sophisticated for you.
>
> Go ahead, try to balance the load. I bet you'll just trip the breaker and lock everything down permanently.
>
> Now, if you'll excuse me, my cucumber slices are getting warm."

## The Challenge

::: {.scenario-block}

Three subsystems control Warehouse B's locks. You must solve systems of equations to find the hidden inventory.

**Task a) Inventory Distribution**

The Grinch has split 150 confiscated presents between Room A and Room B.

* **Equation 1:** Total presents: $A + B = 150$
* **Equation 2:** Room A has 20 more presents than Room B ($A = B + 20$)

> **Grinch's Note:** "Substitution method. If you're struggling, maybe take up knitting instead."

**Objective:** Find the exact number of presents in each room to override the lock.

**Task b) Power Distribution System**

The climate control for Sections X, Y, and Z is interlinked. You must solve for power levels ($x, y, z$) to prevent overheating.

1. $x + y + z = 12$
2. $2x - y + z = 7$
3. $x + 2y - z = 6$

> **Grinch's Note:** "Three equations, three unknowns. Elimination or substitution, your choice. I personally use elimination because it feels more aggressive. Like mathematically eliminating hope."

**Task c) Parallel Processing Paradox**

The Grinch has set up two sorting lines that are graphically represented as **parallel lines**.

> **Grinch's Note:** "Think about what that means for a system of equations. Same slope, different intercepts. The geometry tells you everything about the algebra. It's poetic, really. In a depressing way."

### Status Update

You hit Enter.

The warehouse lights flicker from red to green. The massive doors to Rooms A, B, X, Y, and Z slide open. Inside, thousands of presents sit on shelves, waiting to be rescued.

The Grinch appears on screen. He takes a bite of a cucumber slice.

> **System Message from CEO**
>
> "Crunchy.
>
> Also, I hate you.
>
> You solved a 3-variable system? With elimination? Ugh. You're like a human calculator, but with less personality.
>
> Fine. Warehouse B is compromised. But here's the thing about Warehouse C... it's not just robots. I have *people* working there. Human employees. And let's just say, human problems are rarely linear.
>
> Tomorrow, you'll face **Quadratic Equations**. Because nothing says 'I'm ruining your day' like parabolas.
>
> Don't be late."
> -- GR

**System Status:**

* **Warehouse B:** UNLOCKED
* **Inventory Recovered:** 4,200 units
* **Total Rescued:** 6,700 / 15,000
