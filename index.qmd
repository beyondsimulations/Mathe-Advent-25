**It's December, and something is terribly wrong in Hamburg.**

The Christmas markets at Rathausmarkt stand empty, their wooden huts sealed with digital locks displaying [ERROR messages]{.highlight}. The festive lights along Jungfernstieg are dark—not broken, but deliberately deactivated. At the Speicherstadt warehouses, where thousands of Christmas presents should be ready for distribution, robotic arms sit frozen mid-operation, holding gifts hostage behind impenetrable security protocols.

## What happened?

Everywhere—on digital billboards, phone screens, and even the display at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof—the same message pulses in cold green text:

> **SYSTEM UPDATE COMPLETE**
>
> Christmas v24.12 has been deprecated and replaced with GrinchTech Optimization Protocol v1.0
>
> Your previous holiday traditions have been analyzed and found to be catastrophically inefficient:
>
> - Gift-giving: Negative ROI of -€2.4B annually
> - Festive lighting: 47% energy waste with zero productivity gain
> - Emotional celebration: Unmeasurable KPI, flagged for elimination
> - Santa Claus logistics: Algorithm complexity O(n!) - UNACCEPTABLE
>
> **Christmas has been optimized out of existence.**
>
> All holiday assets have been secured in our proprietary systems. All festive protocols have been replaced with efficiency-first algorithms. Joy has been successfully converted to productivity metrics.
>
> Thank you for your cooperation.
>
> *-- G. Rinch, Founder & CEO, GrinchTech Industries*
>
> *"Moving fast and breaking things (like Christmas)"*

## The Company

GrinchTech Industries appeared in Hamburg's Hafencity just six months ago. Their sleek glass headquarters overlooks the Elbe, and their founder—a mysterious entrepreneur known only as "G. Rinch"—quickly became infamous in Hamburg's business community.

His pitch was simple: 

> "Everything can be optimized. Everything should be optimized. Even Christmas."

The city laughed. The media called him eccentric. Investors threw money at him anyway.

But no one took him seriously until December 1st, when his "Christmas Optimization Platform" went live and locked down the entire city's holiday infrastructure in under 60 seconds.

## Your Mission

You are students at KLU, enrolled in Mathematical Foundations for Business. This morning, you received an emergency summons from Nikolai and Tobias, who lead you to a makeshift crisis center in the university building:

*"Students, Hamburg needs you. The Grinch's algorithms have taken over every system related to Christmas—markets, warehouses, even the power grid for festive lights. The city council, the police, even our IT department—no one can break through his mathematical security protocols."*

*"But you—you understand the mathematics behind these algorithms. You can audit his code, find the flaws, and execute a counter-takeover. You have 24 days until Christmas Eve to dismantle his entire operation piece by piece."*

As if on cue, your phones buzz simultaneously. A new message:

> **#general-announcements**
>
> Well, well. The university is sending children to do mathematics. How adorable.
>
> You think you can crack my algorithms? You think you can find flaws in my perfect systems? Please. I've spent years building these protocols. They're mathematically flawless.
>
> But I'll humor you. Come to my headquarters. Try to get past even the first door. Prove you understand the difference between natural numbers and integers—basic kindergarten mathematics. If you can't solve that, you'll never reach me.
>
> See you never,
> -- GR
>
> P.S. - Christmas stays cancelled. It's just good business.

**Your mission begins now. Christmas depends on you.**

**The clock is ticking. You have 24 days.**

*Good luck! -- Nikolai and Tobias*
