Find where this one fails.”\n\nWhat is the vertical asymptote?\n\nEnter the vertical asymptote (x = ?): \n\n\n\nDefine Safety Boundary\n\n\nSystem 2: “Hole or Asymptote?”\nA secondary control system has the function:\n\\[g(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}\\]\n\nGrinch’s Note: “Not all discontinuities are created equal. Some are catastrophic walls. Others are merely… absences. Gaps that could be filled if someone bothered. Which kind is this?”\n\nAt \\(x = 2\\), is there a hole or a vertical asymptote?\n\n\n A hole   A vertical asymptote   Neither - the function is defined there   Both simultaneously \n\n\n\n\nClassify Discontinuity\n\n\nSystem 3: “The Horizontal Limit”\nThe Grinch’s original cost analysis used:\n\\[AC(x) = \\frac{500 + 10x}{x}\\]\nwhere \\(AC\\) is average cost per household and \\(x\\) is number of households.\n\nGrinch’s Note: “What happens when you scale to infinity?

The Grinch works alongside you, no longer an adversary.\nEmergency 1: “Temperature Escalation”\nThe warehouse temperature \\(T\\) (in °C) is rising according to:\n\\[T(t) = 20 \\cdot 2^{t/5}\\]\nwhere \\(t\\) is time in minutes since the crisis began (currently \\(t = 0\\)).\n\nGrinch’s Note: “At 140°C, irreversible damage begins.

(Round to nearest whole number)\n\nEnter the number of lights: \n\n\n\nStabilize Lighting\n\n\nEmergency 3: “Backup Fund Access”\nThe Grinch reveals he’s been investing in a Christmas restoration fund (apparently feeling guilty). The account grows according to:\n\\[A(t) = 5000 \\cdot e^{0.06t}\\]\nwhere \\(t\\) is years.\n\nGrinch’s Note: “We need €5,985 for emergency repairs. After 3 years, is there enough?

His linear Christmas market model: \\(f(x) = 100x\\) stalls/year. His exponential tech projection: \\(g(x) = 10 \\cdot 2^x\\) facilities/year.\n\nGrinch’s Note: “After 8 years, which dominates? I need to understand my own mistake. I compared short-term data and made long-term conclusions.”\n\nAfter 8 years, which value is larger?\n\n\n Linear growth dominates   Exponential growth dominates   They’re approximately equal   Need more data to determine \n\n\n\n\nAnalyze Error\n\n\n\nStatus Update\nYou input the calculations rapidly:\n\nTemperature at 20 minutes: 320°C (CRITICAL - must act within 15 minutes!) ✓\nLights remaining at 5 hours: ~328 (above emergency threshold) ✓\nBackup funds: ~€5,985 available ✓\nGrowth comparison: Exponential (2,560) far exceeds linear (800) ✓\n\nThe system accepts the codes. The temperature escalation STOPS at 75°C. Emergency cooling activates. The lighting failure stabilizes.\nThe Grinch collapses into a chair, physically exhausted. When he looks at you, there’s something different in his eyes. Gratitude. And something else—understanding.\n\nDIRECT ADDRESS - G. RINCH\n“You stopped it. Everything’s safe.\nAnd you showed me my fundamental error. I was comparing short-term linear growth against long-term exponential potential. I was looking at year 3, not year 8.\nIf Hamburg had let Christmas markets grow for another 5 years, they would have exponentially exceeded my projections. I shut them down precisely when they were about to explode with growth.\nI made a mathematical error. And nearly destroyed everything because of it.\nThank you. For the math, and for… for helping when you didn’t have to.\nThree more systems remain. But I’m not testing you anymore. We’re working together now. Let’s finish this. Properly.”\n– G.

The Grinch has named each scenario with his characteristic dramatic flair.\nLock 1: “The Inflation Avalanche”\nA 4% inflation rate effectively shifts all costs upward by 4 units.\n\nGrinch’s Note: “Vertical shifts. Add to the function. This is… genuinely the easiest transformation. If you miss this, I’m going to assume you’re doing it on purpose to waste my time.”\n\nIf \\(f(x)\\) shifts UP by 4 units, what is the constant term in \\(g(x)\\)?\n\n\n \\(+3\\)   \\(+7\\)   \\(-1\\)   \\(+4\\) \n\n\n\n\nApply Inflation Model\n\n\nLock 2: “The Regulatory Shift”\nNew EU regulations create administrative overhead, shifting all operations LEFT by 3 time units.

But transformations work both ways. Government support shifts functions UP. Efficiency improvements reflect profit-positive. Market growth stretches revenue.”\nYou pull up your own analysis: “If we apply realistic positive transformations—EU Christmas market subsidies (shift up 10), local tourism growth (stretch 1.5), operational efficiencies (shift left 2 for earlier profitability)—the transformed function shows INCREASED profit, not decreased.”\nThe Grinch’s expression flickers. He wasn’t expecting a counter-analysis.\n\n#transformation-analysis\n“Clever. You didn’t just calculate transformations—you understood that transformations can be positive or negative depending on context.\nFine. You understand function transformations. You can defend against my external shock scenarios.\nBut here’s the final business test: REVERSIBILITY. Can you undo my optimizations? Can you find inverse functions?

You can construct linear models. You understand parallel and perpendicular relationships. Basic business mathematics.\nBut here’s the thing about linear growth: it’s a fairy tale. Real businesses don’t grow linearly forever—they follow curves. Quadratic functions. Diminishing returns. There’s always a peak where profit maximizes and then declines.\nTomorrow, I’ll show you Hamburg’s REAL economic models: parabolas. Vertex points.

Cubics that require actual technique to decompose.\nBut mathematics isn’t just about solving individual equations. It’s about solving them fast. Under pressure. When the numbers are exponential and the clock is logarithmic.\nTomorrow, I’m introducing countdown timers that decay exponentially. Security layers that require logarithmic thinking. The kind of mathematics where every second costs you.\nYou beat my failsafe with 8 minutes to spare. Let’s see how you do when the margin is measured in moments.”\n– GR\n\nThe warehouse is safe. The presents are secure. But you’re running out of time.\nCritical Systems Restored:\n\n✓ Fire suppression calibrated\n✓ Structural integrity monitors online\n✓ Emergency failsafes deactivated\n\nStatus: Warehouse C emergency averted. 14 days until Christmas Eve.\nBack to the calendar"

Their sleek glass headquarters overlooks the Elbe, and their founder—a mysterious entrepreneur known only as “G. Rinch”—quickly became infamous in Hamburg’s business community.\nHis pitch was simple:\n\n“Everything can be optimized. Everything should be optimized. Even Christmas.”\n\nThe city laughed. The media called him eccentric. Investors threw money at him anyway.\nBut no one took him seriously until December 1st, when his “Christmas Optimization Platform” went live and locked down the entire city’s holiday infrastructure in under 60 seconds."

This morning, you received an emergency summons from Nikolai and Tobias, who lead you to a makeshift crisis center in the university building:\n“Students, Hamburg needs you. The Grinch’s algorithms have taken over every system related to Christmas—markets, warehouses, even the power grid for festive lights. The city council, the police, even our IT department—no one can break through his mathematical security protocols.”\n“But you—you understand the mathematics behind these algorithms. You can audit his code, find the flaws, and execute a counter-takeover. You have 24 days until Christmas Eve to dismantle his entire operation piece by piece.”\nAs if on cue, your phones buzz simultaneously. A new message:\n\n#general-announcements\nWell, well. The university is sending children to do mathematics. How adorable.\nYou think you can crack my algorithms? You think you can find flaws in my perfect systems? Please. I’ve spent years building these protocols. They’re mathematically flawless.\nBut I’ll humor you. Come to my headquarters. Try to get past even the first door. Prove you understand the difference between natural numbers and integers—basic kindergarten mathematics. If you can’t solve that, you’ll never reach me.\nSee you never, – GR\nP.S. - Christmas stays cancelled. It’s just good business.\n\nYour mission begins now. Christmas depends on you.\nThe clock is ticking. You have 24 days.\nGood luck! – Nikolai and Tobias"

The Grinch has titled them with his signature blend of smugness and business jargon.\nLock 1: “The Vertex of Destiny”\nA Hamburg toy manufacturer has a profit function \\(P(x)\\) (in thousands of euros) for selling \\(x\\) hundreds of toys:\n\\[P(x) = -x^2 + 10x - 16\\]\n\nGrinch’s Note: “I’m not giving you the formula. That’s what lectures are for. If you actually paid attention in class instead of scrolling through your phone, this would take you about 30 seconds.

Now find the y-coordinate. This is called ‘substitution.’ Kindergarteners can do this. Well, smart kindergarteners.”\n\nWhat is the maximum profit (in thousands of euros)?\n\n\n €5,000   €9,000   €16,000   €25,000 \n\n\n\n\nCalculate Maximum Profit\n\n\nLock 3: “The Interpretation Gauntlet”\nThe Grinch claims the vertex represents “the point of inevitable decline.” But what does the vertex ACTUALLY mean in business terms?\n\nGrinch’s Note: “I’m testing your comprehension, not your calculation. What does the vertex mean for the business? This is where most students reveal they memorized formulas without understanding them.”\n\nWhich interpretation is correct?\n\n\n The business must shut down after 500 toys   The business loses €9,000 at optimal production   Producing exactly 500 toys yields maximum profit of €9,000   The business should produce as many toys as possible \n\n\n\n\nSubmit Interpretation\n\n\nLock 4: “The Geometry of Efficiency”\nA gingerbread house production area has a perimeter constraint of 40 inches. What dimensions maximize the floor area?\n\nGrinch’s Note: “This is a classic problem. I’ve seen it stump entire MBA cohorts. You’d think people with business degrees would understand floor space, but you’d be wrong. Prove you’re smarter than the average executive.”\n\nFor maximum area with perimeter = 40, what is the length of each side?\n\nEnter the dimension (in inches): \n\n\n\nOptimize Floor Space\n\n\n\nStatus Update\nYou present your analysis to the Chamber of Commerce:\n\nOptimal production: 500 toys (vertex at x = 5) ✓\nMaximum profit: €9,000 (achievable and sustainable) ✓\nVertex interpretation: Optimal operation point, NOT inevitable decline ✓\nSpace optimization: 10 × 10 inches (square maximizes area) ✓\n\nStadtrat Fischer nods enthusiastically. “So the Grinch’s models aren’t wrong—his INTERPRETATION is wrong?”\n“Exactly,” you confirm. “He’s claiming Hamburg is past the optimization point. But the mathematics shows Hamburg should operate AT the vertex—at 500 toys with €9,000 profit—not shut down entirely. The vertex isn’t a point of decline. It’s the optimal operating target.”\nThe Grinch sets down his juice. His expression suggests he just realized his argument has a significant flaw.\n\n#economic-analysis-update\n“…Fine. You understand vertex optimization. You can calculate maximum profit. You interpreted the quadratic model correctly.\nBut here’s the thing about static models: they’re fiction. Real economies don’t stay frozen at a single point—they TRANSFORM over time. Costs shift up. Revenues compress. Inflation stretches everything. External factors change the entire shape of your precious profit curve.\nTomorrow, let’s discuss transformations. How external economic factors shift, stretch, and reflect your clean mathematical models into something messier. Something more real.\nLet’s see how you handle functions that move.”\n– GR\n\nAct III Progress:\n\n✓ Function fundamentals verified\n✓ Linear business models validated\n✓ Quadratic optimization mastered\nFunction transformations: Tomorrow\nEconomic validation: Nearly complete\n\nStatus: Quadratic models support optimal Christmas operations at vertex.\nTime Remaining: 9 days until Christmas Eve\nBack to the calendar"

    "text": "It’s the final day of the economic review. The full City Council has assembled, along with business leaders, market vendors, and economists. The decision will be made today: Does Christmas reopen, or does the Grinch’s economic analysis stand?\nThe Grinch appears on the main video screen. He’s wearing a formal blazer. This is clearly the most effort he’s put into his appearance all month.\n“Today’s test is different,” he announces. “We’re not just analyzing functions. We’re asking whether my optimizations can be UNDONE.”\n\nSystem Message from CEO\n“Hamburg City Council. Honored Guests.\nWe’ve spent days analyzing functions. Linear models. Quadratic optimization. Transformations. And these mathematical auditors have impressed me—I’ll admit that much.\nBut here’s the ultimate test: REVERSIBILITY.\nI’ve ‘optimized’ Christmas. I’ve transformed Hamburg’s holiday operations through multiple mathematical functions—pricing changes, cost compressions, distribution reconfigurations. These transformations are COMPOSED—layered on top of each other.\nTo truly restore Christmas, you need to REVERSE every transformation I’ve applied. Find the inverse functions. Decompose my layered optimizations.\nIf you can’t find the inverse functions, you can’t restore original operations. Christmas stays optimized into non-existence.\nThis is your final economic challenge.”\n– GR"

    "text": "The Challenge\n\nThree problems testing inverse functions and function composition—the mathematics of reversal.\nLock 1: “The Price Reversal Protocol”\nThe Grinch has converted Hamburg’s hot chocolate pricing using the function:\n\\[P(q) = 50 - 2q\\]\nwhere \\(P\\) is price in euros and \\(q\\) is quantity sold.\n\nGrinch’s Note: “Vendors need the inverse: given a price, how many units are being sold? Swap variables, solve for the new dependent variable. This is function inversion 101. If you struggle here, the rest of this will be… painful.”\n\nFind the inverse function. What is the coefficient of \\(P\\) when \\(q\\) is expressed in terms of \\(P\\)?\n\n\n \\(-2\\)   \\(-0.5\\) or \\(-1/2\\)   \\(+0.5\\)   \\(+2\\) \n\n\n\n\nReverse Pricing Model\n\n\nLock 2: “The Composition Conundrum”\nThe Grinch’s system applies TWO transformations in sequence:\n\nFirst transformation: \\(f(x) = 2x + 1\\) (pricing adjustment)\nSecond transformation: \\(g(x) = x - 3\\) (cost reduction)\n\n\nGrinch’s Note: “Function composition. I’ve seen tears. It was delightful. Figure out which function goes where.”\n\nCalculate \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\). What is the constant term?\n\nEnter the constant term: \n\n\n\nCompose Functions\n\n\nLock 3: “The Core Algorithm Inversion”\nThe Grinch’s central “Christmas Optimization” algorithm is:\n\\[f(x) = x^3 + 8\\]\nTo restore original Christmas operations, you need the inverse function.\n\nGrinch’s Note: “Cubic inversion. If you remember that cube roots can handle negative numbers (unlike square roots), you might just survive this.”\n\nWhat is the inverse function \\(f^{-1}(x)\\)?\n\n\n \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x + 8}\\)   \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x - 8}\\)   \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt{x - 8}\\)   \\(f^{-1}(x) = x^3 - 8\\) \n\n\n\n\nRestore Original Algorithm\n\n\n\nStatus Update\nYou present the inverse functions to the City Council:\n\nPrice reversal: \\(q(P) = 25 - \\frac{P}{2}\\) (coefficient of P is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\)) ✓\nFunction composition: \\((f \\circ g)(x) = 2(x-3) + 1 = 2x - 5\\) (constant is \\(-5\\)) ✓\nCore algorithm inverse: \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x - 8}\\) ✓\n\n“This means,” you explain to the Council, “that every transformation the Grinch applied can be mathematically reversed. His optimizations aren’t permanent. His economic models aren’t irreversible. Christmas CAN be restored to its original operational state.”\nStadtrat Fischer stands. “The mathematics is clear. Every economic argument GrinchTech presented has been countered with rigorous analysis. I move that we approve the reopening of Hamburg’s Christmas markets.”\nThe vote is unanimous: APPROVED.\nThe Grinch is silent for a long moment. Then, slowly, he nods.\n\n#final-assessment\n“You did it. You actually did it.\nFunctions. Linear models. Quadratic optimization. Transformations. Inverses. Composition. You proved that Christmas is economically viable. That my optimization can be reversed. That the mathematics supports holiday operations.\nI… may have been wrong about the business case.\nBut there’s still a problem: My TECHNICAL infrastructure. The Christmas market control systems, the city lighting grid, the distribution algorithms—they’re still locked behind my advanced mathematical protocols.\nYou’ve won the economic argument. Now you need to win the TECHNICAL battle.\nDays 18-24: Advanced Functions and Final Systems. Polynomials. Exponential systems. Logarithmic controls. Rational functions. Everything I have left.\nThis is the endgame. If you can crack these, I’ll release full control.\nSee you in the final act.”\n– GR\n\nACT III: BUSINESS MODEL ANALYSIS - COMPLETE ✓\nMajor Achievement: City Council unanimously approves Christmas market reopening\nProgress Update:\n\n✓ Mathematical foundations mastered\n✓ Equations & problem-solving complete\n✓ Supply chain operational\n✓ Economic viability PROVEN\nTechnical systems: Still locked\nMarket controls: Still offline\nCity lighting: Still dark\n\nACT IV: THE FINAL TAKEOVER - Begins Tomorrow\nTime Remaining: 7 days until Christmas Eve\nBack to the calendar"
